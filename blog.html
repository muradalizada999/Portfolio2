                <h3>Designing Websites with Just HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">December 11, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    You don't need advanced frameworks to design clean and usable websites. 
                    With basic HTML for structure and CSS for styling, it's possible to create 
                    simple layouts that look good and work well. Learning the basics first 
                    makes everything else easier later.

                <h3>Keeping Designs Simple and Readable</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">December 11, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Simple design is often better than complex design. Using clear fonts, 
                    enough spacing, and consistent colors makes a website easier to read. 
                    Focusing on simplicity helped me avoid clutter and improve the overall 
                    user experience.

                <h3>Using Basic Layout Techniques</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">December 11, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Flexbox and simple CSS Grid layouts are powerful tools for organizing content. 
                    They make it easier to align elements and adapt layouts to different screen sizes. 
                    Even basic layout rules can greatly improve the structure of a webpage.

                <h3>Tools I Use for Simple Web Design</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">December 11, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    For designing websites, I mainly rely on simple tools. A code editor like VS Code, 
                    a web browser for testing, and basic developer tools are more than enough. 
                    These tools help me design, test, and improve websites efficiently.

                <h3>Learning by Building Small Designs</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">December 11, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Creating small website sections such as navigation bars, cards, and forms 
                    helped me understand design principles better. Each small design experiment 
                    improved my skills and confidence in working with simple web technologies.

                <h3>Why Simple Tools Are Enough to Start</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">December 11, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Starting with simple tools removes unnecessary complexity. By focusing on 
                    HTML and CSS, I was able to understand how websites are built from the ground up. 
                    This foundation makes learning advanced tools and frameworks much easier later on.
